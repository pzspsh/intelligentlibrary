	// most significant bit represents the coefficient of x⁰ and the least significant
	// bit represents the coefficient of xⁿ⁻¹ (the coefficient for xⁿ is implicit).
	//
	// For example, CRC32-Q, as defined by the following polynomial,
	//	x³²+ x³¹+ x²⁴+ x²²+ x¹⁶+ x¹⁴+ x⁸+ x⁷+ x⁵+ x³+ x¹+ x⁰
	// has the reversed notation 0b11010101100000101000001010000001, so the value
	// that should be passed to MakeTable is 0xD5828281.
